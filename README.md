Software Development Lifecycle

Students will explore the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through the lens of developers and testers to examine the characteristics, documentation, and purpose of each stage. Through applying SDLC stages within an agile development environment, students will learn the principles and best practices used to develop high quality software while also assessing the impact of communication, documentation, and ethics on the SDLC.
